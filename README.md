## 1. Introduction

The **Used Car Price Prediction** software is designed to predict the price of a used car based on various factors like car model, fuel type, body type, mileage, transmission, and location. It uses machine learning techniques, primarily **XGBoost** and **Random Forest**, to analyze past car sales and make price predictions.

This README provides instructions for setting up and running the app, as well as additional details on the machine learning process, data preprocessing, and deployment with Streamlit.

## 3. Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up the software:

1. **Install Python**: 
   - Download and install the latest version of Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Set up a virtual environment** *(optional but recommended)*:
   - Create a virtual environment using the command:
     ```bash
     python -m venv car_prediction_env
     ```
   - Activate the environment:
     - On Windows:
       ```bash
       car_prediction_env\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - On macOS/Linux:
       ```bash
       source car_prediction_env/bin/activate
       ```

3. **Install the required libraries**:
   - Run the following command to install the necessary Python libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install streamlit pandas joblib openpyxl xgboost scikit-learn matplotlib numpy
     ```

4. **Run the application**:
   - Navigate to the folder containing the app and run the following command to start the app:
     ```bash
     streamlit run app.py
     ```

## 4. Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is an important step where the raw data is cleaned and transformed. The key steps involved are:

- **Data Cleaning**: Remove columns with over 50% missing values and duplicates. Outliers are removed using the **Z-score** method.
- **Feature Engineering**: Use **One-Hot Encoding** to convert categorical variables (e.g., fuel type, body type) into numerical formats that machine learning models can understand.
- **Handling Categorical Data**: Convert features like 'Fuel Type', 'Body Type', and 'Drive Type' into numerical representations.
- **Final Dataset**: After preprocessing, the dataset is cleaned and ready for training the machine learning models.

## 5. Model Training and Evaluation

The software uses machine learning models like **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** to predict used car prices.

### Steps involved:

1. **Training the Model**:
   - Train Random Forest and XGBoost models on the cleaned dataset using **Supervised Learning**.
   - Use **Cross-validation** to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Apply **Random Search Cross-Validation (CV)** to optimize model parameters.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, **R-Squared (RÂ²)**, and **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)** are used to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.

## 6. Streamlit Web App Overview

The **Used Car Price Prediction** app uses **Streamlit**, a Python-based framework to create web apps with minimal code. The app allows users to input car details and get real-time price predictions.

### Key Features:
- **Categorical Inputs**: Dropdown menus to select car features like fuel type, body type, and color.
- **Numerical Inputs**: Sliders and number inputs for engine displacement, mileage, and kilometers driven.
- **Reset Button**: Allows users to reset inputs to default values.

---

## 7. How the Prediction Works

Once the user enters the car details, the following steps occur:

1. **Input Handling**: The app collects the user inputs such as fuel type, body type, engine capacity, and other details.
2. **Preprocessing**: Input data is preprocessed using the same steps as the training data (e.g., One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables).
3. **Prediction**: The preprocessed data is passed to the trained **XGBoost** model, which makes a price prediction based on the learned patterns.
4. **Result Display**: The predicted price is displayed in **Indian Rupees (INR)**, formatted with commas for better readability.

## 8. Mathematical and Computational Concepts

Here are some key computational and mathematical concepts used in the software:

- **One-Hot Encoding**: Converts categorical variables into binary columns.
- **Supervised Learning**: The model is trained on labeled data (input features and car price).
- **Cross-Validation**: The data is split into training and validation sets multiple times to evaluate model performance.
- **Random Search Cross-Validation**: A method for hyperparameter tuning that searches through random combinations of parameters.

## 9. Understanding the User Interface

### Sidebar:
- **Dropdown Menus**: Used to select car details like fuel type, body type, and location.
- **Number Inputs**: Used to enter values like kilometers driven, mileage, and engine displacement.

### Main Page:
- **Predict Price Button**: Clicking this button triggers the price prediction process.
- **Predicted Price Display**: The predicted price of the car is displayed in Indian Rupees (INR).
